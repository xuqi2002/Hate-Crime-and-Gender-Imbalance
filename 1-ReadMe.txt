Operating system used for this analysis. 
- macOS version 10.15.6.  
- MacBook Pro. 
- Processor: 2.4 GHz 8-core Intel Core i9.
- Memory: 32 GB 2667 MHz DDR4

The analyses were carried out using R version 4.0.2. 

The following R packages were used:
readstata13  #  version 0.9.2
MASS # version 7.3-51.6  
sandwich  # version 2.5-1 
lmtest # version 0.9-37
stargazer # version 5.2.2
list # version 9.2
pBrackets # version 1.0

# Main Analysis
# ##################

Please run "master.R."  Then, every table and figure will be produced.
To reproduce all numbers we computed from our datasets, please run "number_in_texts.R".
"Help.R" contains several custom functions we use for analyses. 

Below, we explain individual codes called in "master.R" But, to replicate results, analysts just need to run "master.R" 


# ##############################
# Reproduce Analysis Data Sets
# ##############################
"context.dta" and "context_placebo.dta" are produced by merging source data. All source data are in folder "source_data". 
To reproduce the two analysis data sets, please follow the following steps. 
(1) Run "produce_context_data.do" in STATA (version 16) to produce intermediate datasets "merged_context_1.dta" and "merged_context_2.dta"
(2) Run "merge_context.R" in R to produce "context.dta"
(3) Run "merge_context_placebo.R" in R to produce "context_placebo.dta"

Files and Code to reproduce results on context analysis in the paper.
      code: ContextAnalysis_Main.R
      data: context.dta
      results: Figure 1 and Figure C8

Files and Code to reproduce results on survey analysis in the paper.
      code: SurveyAnalysis_Main.R
      data: survey.dta
      results: Figure 2, Figure 3, Table 1, Figure 4

Files and Code to reproduce results on context analysis in the Appendix.
      code: ContextAnalysis_Appendix.R
      data: context.dta and context_placebo.dta
      results: Table C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C9, and Figure C10
      Note: we stored bootstrap results as "out_count_table.rdata", which is used to produce Table C5, because it is computationally expensive. â€¨      The exact code to reproduce this rdata is given in line 400-417 of "ContextAnalysis_Appendix.R". 

Files and Code to reproduce results on survey analysis in the Appendix.
      code: SurveyAnalysis_Appendix.R
      data: survey.dta and YouGov.dta
      results: Figure D2, D3, D4_1, D4_2, Table D.5.1, D.5.2, D.6.1,
      Figure D.6.2, Table D.6.3, D.6.4, D.8.1, D.8.2
